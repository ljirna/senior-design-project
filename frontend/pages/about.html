    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        Founded in 1998, amidst a period of rebuilding and renewal, ZiM Commerce
        began with a simple, heartfelt vision: to bring beautiful, well-crafted
        furniture within everyone's reach. What started as a single, humble shop
        on a local street corner was built on the principles of durability, honest
        value, and a belief that a welcoming home is the foundation of a good
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years, we served our neighbors, learning the rhythms of our community
        and the specific needs of Bosnian households. We listened, adapted, and
        slowly, our reputation for reliable quality and personable service began
        to grow. As the digital age dawned, we saw an opportunity to extend our
        commitment beyond our city limits, evolving from a beloved local shop into
        a pioneering force in furniture e-commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our growth has been organic, rooted in the trust of our customers. While
        our catalog has expanded and our logistics network has grown more
        sophisticated, our core mission remains unchanged: to be your local
        partner in creating a home you love, wherever you are in our corner of the
        world.
